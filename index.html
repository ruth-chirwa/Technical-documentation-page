              <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is essential for styling and layout adjustments based on different device characteristics. </p>
              <p>Utilize viewport units (vw, vh, vmin, vmax) for responsive sizing relative to the viewport dimensions.</p>

          <p>JavaScript is often used in responsive web design to enhance the user experience, 
            handle dynamic behavior, and make adjustments based on user interactions or device characteristics.</p>
          <p>Use JavaScript to load additional content or assets asynchronously based on the user's device or screen size. 
            This can help optimize page load times.</p>
          <code>
            document.getElementById('button').addEventListener('click', function() {
                // Handle button click
              });
